Hello, welcome to my personal webpage
======
I am an atmospheric physicist focusing on:

* Atmospheric radiative transfer,
* Light and electromagnetic scattering,
* Atmospheric and oceanic remote sensing.

I am also interested in applications of radiative transfer and light scattering theories and techniques in astronomy, planetary sciences, bio-medical optics and more. 

Please take a look at [my CV](cv/) and [my publications](publications/) for more details.

Hello, welcome to my personal webpage
======
I am an atmospheric physicist focusing on:

* Atmospheric radiative transfer,
* Light and electromagnetic scattering,
* Atmospheric and oceanic remote sensing.

My research on radiative transfer and light scattering aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of remote sensing and climate/weather modeling, and deepen our understanding of the atmosphere and terrestrial environment.

I developed a vector radiative transfer model [(VRTM)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022407319304340) and associated [Jacobian computational model](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/80/1/JAS-D-22-0112.1.xml) for a coupled atmosphere-land-ocean system, in support of remote sensing using radiometric and polarimetric observations. The VRTM was developed based on the state-of-the-art radiative transfer and light scattering theories and techniques, and is featured with high accuracy and efficiency.

I recently made a breakthrough in [light scattering by spheroidal particles](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-31-24-40937&id=542527), which is reported in the [ELS Newsletter](https://www.astro.umd.edu/~elsnews/issue116.htm). Starting from Maxwellâ€™s equations, I derived an analytical solution to optical properties of spheroids based on spheroidal coordinates. Compared with previous studies, my new formulation is much more numerically stable, and the maximum applicable particle size is extended by more than __30 times__. The new approach will be used to simulate optical properties of nonspherical particles such as coarse-mode aerosol and oceanic particles for radiative transfer parameterization in climate/weather models and remote sensing retrieval algorithms. The new approach can also model optical properties of interstellar dust for astronomical applications and of biological cells to facilitate biomedical optics research.

My research also includes the study of optical and microphysical properties of ice clouds and dust aerosol employing satellite observations in visible, infrared and microwave bands. Please take a look at [my CV](cv/) and [my publications](publications/) for more details.

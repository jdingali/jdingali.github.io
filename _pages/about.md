Hello, welcome to my personal webpage
======
I am an atmospheric physicist focusing on:

* Atmospheric radiative transfer,
* Light and electromagnetic scattering,
* Atmospheric and oceanic remote sensing,
* Planetary atmosphere remote sensing,
* Interstellar dust measurement.

My research on radiative transfer and light scattering aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of remote sensing and climate/weather modeling, and deepen our understanding of the atmosphere and terrestrial environment.

I recently made a breakthrough in light scattering by [homogeneous](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-31-24-40937&id=542527) and [two-layer](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-33-19-40532) spheroidal particles, which is reported in the [ELS Newsletter](https://www.astro.umd.edu/~elsnews/issue116.htm). Starting from Maxwell’s equations, I derived analytical solutions to optical properties of spheroids in the spheroidal coordinate system. Compared with previous studies, my new formulations are much more numerically stable, and the maximum applicable particle size is extended by more than __30 times__. The applicable particle size range covers size distributions of all atmospheric aerosol particles. The new approach has been used to simulate optical properties of nonspherical particles such as coarse-mode aerosol and oceanic particles for radiative transfer parameterization in climate/weather models and remote sensing retrieval algorithms. The new approach can also model optical properties of interstellar dust for astronomical applications and of biological cells to facilitate biomedical optics research.

I developed a vector radiative transfer model [(VRTM)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022407319304340) and associated [Jacobian computational model](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/80/1/JAS-D-22-0112.1.xml) for a coupled atmosphere-land-ocean system, in support of remote sensing using radiometric and polarimetric observations. The VRTM was developed based on the state-of-the-art radiative transfer and light scattering theories and techniques, and is featured with high accuracy and efficiency. A recent update extended the applicability of the VRTM to partially oriented and chiral particles, which are commonly ignored in most of other VRTM. Numerical simulation shows that the reflectivity and polarization signatures of the oriented and chiral particles in the atmosphere are significant and can be detected with polarimeters in thermal infrared and circular polarization measurement.


My research also includes the study of optical and microphysical properties of ice clouds and dust aerosol employing satellite observations in visible, infrared and microwave bands. For example, I used a combination of [spaceborne lidar and radiometer](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-24-1-620&id=335406) to constrain the microphysical and optical properties of cirrus clouds. I developed a temperature-dependent ice crystal optical properties in microwave frequencies for [radar and microwave/sub-millimeter radiometry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022407316306367) remote sensing.

I am also interested in the applications of radiative transfer and light scattering techniques in other fields, such as planetary sciences and astronomy. A halo was observed on Mars in 2022. Based on my light scattering simulation results, we found that the halo was a result of a mixture of [water and CO<sub>2</sub> ice crystals](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023GL103457). I developed a [3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer model](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac1069) to infer interstellar dust properties from observations of a supernova. Based on the model, I also developed [an innovative method](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/acd37c) to estimate the distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).
